## Module 3 Project

*Description*

This repo contains the following:
1. tidy.txt (output dataset)
2. run_analysis.R (code use for data cleaning and preparation)

The train and test datasets were merged using rbind(). I got only information about the mean and standard deviation as instructed. I've renamed its columns using the names from features text file then I've added lables from activity_labels text file. From here, I've created the final dataset.
